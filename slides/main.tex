\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{In 1965, Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel, predicted that the number of transistors on a microchip would double every two years, while the cost would be halved(halfed). 

This prediction has been proven(prove) to be true for the past 50 years. 

The figure shows the growth of the number of transistors from 1965 to 2015, shown in blue. 
The feature size which describes the size of the transistor, shown in yellow gets smaller and smaller.

\note{
  As the feature size of transistor approaches the atomic(a-tuo-mic) scale, Moore's law is facing challenges. 

In the atomic scale, the quantum effects become significant, and classical physics(phy-sic-s) is no longer valid.

This makes it impossible to continue the growth of the number of transistors on a microchip.

To continue the growth of computing power, the development of new technologies is required.

%Traditional silicon(ci-li-ken)-based computers are reaching their physical limits, and the development of new technologies is required to continue the growth of computing power. 

%Quantum computing is one of the most promising technologies that can potentially solve problems that are intractable(intra-ct-ble) for classical computers.

  \item Quantum Advantage VS Classical Simulation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{Recently, quantum computing has attracted(attract-ed) a lot of attention from both academia and industry(in-de-stry).

These are some reports about quantum computing from New york Times and Global Times.

Compared to classical computers, quantum computers are based on the principles of quantum mechanics(mi-can-ni-kes), such as superposition and entanglement. 


These properties bring a new look to computation. %and have the potential to solve problems that are intractable(intra-ct-ble) for classical computers.

The key question we’ll address is: if quantum computers are really better than classical computers?

There are two sides to this debate(\textipa{di'beit}).

One is the quantum advantage.
This term describes the quantum computers have the ability to complete computation task which are beyond the reach of classical computers.

For example, Google claimed(\textipa{kleimd}) their Sycamore quantum computer can perform a computation task in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputer ten thousands years.

The other side is the classical simulation.
Some people argue that by find the weakness of the quantum computer, the classical computer can simulate the quantum computer efficiently.
For specific computation task, if efficient classical simulation can be achieved, the claims(\textipa{kleɪmz}) of quantum advantage in this task would be broken.

%Or using optimized algorithms and resources, the classical computer can still handle some tasks that quantum computers can do.




%Classical simulation techniques have advanced rapidly, narrowing the gap and challenging quantum supremacy claims. Some researchers argue that classical computers might still handle these tasks, albeit with optimized algorithms and resources.
%For example, last month Google announced their new quantum chip "Willow"(wei-low), which can solve a problem in 5 minutes that would take the world's fastest(fas-test) supercomputer in 10 septillion(sep-ti-lian) years.

%But what is quantum computing? And how does it work? Let's review the history of quantum computing.

\note{
  Today I will introduce our recont work on this topic.
  We propose a classical simulation method which can simulate a broad class of quantum algorithms with polynomial scale cost.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Historical Background}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{fig/feynman.png}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{itemize}%~\footcite{feynman2018simulating}
    \item In the 1980s, Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman proposed the idea of quantum computing.
    \item \textbf{Motivation:} When classical computers simulate quantum systems, the cost grows \textcolor{red}{exponentially} with the number of particles. 
    \item \textbf{Solution:} Build a computer based on quantum mechanics.
    %\begin{itemize}
    %    \item Quantum simulation: simulate quantum systems efficiently.
    %\end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Key Questions:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How do we develop \textbf{useful quantum algorithms}?
    \item How do we handle \textbf{quantum noise}?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
  In the 1980s, Yuri Manin(ma-ni) and Richard Feynman independently proposed the idea of quantum computing.

  The motivation is that when classical computers simulate quantum systems, the cost grows exponentially with the number of particles.

  A possible solution is to build a computer based on quantum mechanics.

  But there are two key questions to be addressed.
  First, at that time, there is no useful quantum algorithms. And people are not sure whether quantum algorithms are really better than classical algorithms.

  Second, the quantum noises are unavoidable(un-avoid-able) in quantum systems, which will destroy the quantum information.
  How to protect the quantum information from noise is a key issue in quantum computing.
  

%Feynman pointed out that when classical computers simulate quantum systems, as the number of particles increases, the time required for calculation will increase exponentially. %which is completely incompetent(in-com-pe-tent). 

The solution is to build a computer based on quantum mechanics. 

%This motivation is called quantum simulation, which aims to simulate quantum systems efficiently. 

%And it remains one of the core purposes of building quantum computers today.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Shor's Algorithms}
  Useful quantum algorithms:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In 1994~\footfullcite{shor1994algorithms}, Peter Shor proposed a quantum algorithm that can factorize large numbers in \textcolor{red}{polynomial time}.
    %\item Large numbers factorization: Knowing big number $N$, which is the product of two prime numbers $p$ and $q$. What are $p$ and $q$?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Classical Algorithms:} Best known algorithm require \textcolor{red}{sub-exponential} time.
      %\item The intractability of the factorization problem is the cornerstone of modern encryption.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/shor.png}
    \end{figure}
    %\item In 1996~\footcite{grover1996fast}, Lov Grover proposed a quantum algorithm that can search an unsorted database in \textcolor{red}{quadratic time}, while the best classical algorithm is \textcolor{red}{linear}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
A breakthrough in quantum algorithms came in 1994.  
In 1994, Peter Shor proposed a quantum algorithm that can factorize(fact-rize) large numbers in polynomial time.

The factorization of large numbers is a classic problem.% in number theory(see-ri). 
Given a big number N, which is the product of two prime(pri-me) numbers p and q. The  question is what p and q are?

The best classical algorithm for factorization is sub-exponential(ex-po-nential) time.

The intractability(intra-ct-a-bile-ty) of the factorization problem is the cornerstone(cor-ner-stone) of modern encryption(en-cre-pu-tion), such as RSA.

%And the quantum algorithm poses(po-ses) a threat(si-rea-te) to the security of many commercial encryption systems.

Here is a comparison(com-par-re-sen) between the classical and quantum algorithms for factorization.

It is estimated that a 4K-length RSA key can be broken in 4 hours by shor's algorithm. While even for classical computers in 2042, it will take 10 to 22 years.}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quantum Error Correction}
  Protect quantum information from noise:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Noise is inevitable in quantum systems.
    \item Peter Shor~\footfullcite{shor1995scheme} proposed to use error correction codes to protect quantum information from noise.
    %\begin{itemize}
      %\item Quantum error correction codes: encode quantum information in a larger Hilbert space.
      %\item Quantum error correction is difficult due to the properties of quantum mechanics.
      %\begin{itemize} 
      %\item No-cloning theorem
      %\item Collapse of the wave function
      
      %\dots
      %\end{itemize}
    %\end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{%Depending on complexity theory, quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

After the proposal of Shor's algorithm, the actual construction of quantum computers becomes a hot topic. Academia, industry, and even governments have invested a lot of resources in this field.

However, the development of quantum computers is not as smooth as expected(ex-pec-ted). 

The quantum information is easily destroyed by the environment, leading to a process(pro-cess) called decoherence.

To protect quantum information from noise, Peter shor proposed to use error correction codes to encode quantum information in a larger Hilbert space.
Which is a promising way to protect quantum information.


However quantum error correction is difficult to perform. %due(du-to) to the properties of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning(clone-lin) theorem(see-rem) and the collapse(co-la-pse) of the wave function.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Error Correction is Expensive}
 The implementation of quantum error correction is described in seven stages, described in 2013. %Each advancement requires mastery of the preceding stages, but each also represents a continuing task that must be perfected in parallel with the others. Superconducting qubits are the only solid-state implementation at the third stage, and they now aim at reaching the fourth stage (green arrow). In the domain of atomic physics and quantum optics, the third stage had been previously attained by trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. No implementation has yet reached the fourth stage, where a logical qubit can be stored, via error correction, for a time substantially longer than the decoherence time of its physical qubit components.

\note{The implementation of quantum error correction is described in seven stages, as shown in the figure. 

%Each advancement requires mastery of the preceding stages, but each also represents a continuing task that must be perfected in parallel with the others.

In 2013, we were at the third stage and tried to reach the fourth stage, as the green arrow shows.

The third stage describes the necessary operations for quantum error correction such as measurement and control can be performed.

The fourth stage is the logical qubit has a longer coherence time than the physical qubits.

In other words, it describes the error correction scheme(si-game) can bring positive effects in the real quantum devices.

Actually after 10 years, marked by USTC in last year, and Google Willow in last month, the quantum error correction reaches the fourth stage.

While the Shor's factorization algorithm is at the top stage.

 The difference is using parameterized(per-ramite-rized:\textipa{pə'ræmitəraizd}) quantum circuits instead of artificial neural networks as learning models.


 The quantum computer is used as a co-processor to run the model and evaluate the loss function.
  
 Then, a classical computer is used to %iteratively(it-rea-tively) 
 adjust these parameters(per-ramiter-s) to minimize the loss function, and searching for the optimal solution.

   \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Simulation Method:} A method to simulate the noisy observable value of variational quantum algorithms without assumptions of locality, low entanglement entropy, or circuit depth.

   \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}
 \note{
  Variational quantum algorithms are designed for NISQ devices, which are noisy. A question is whether the quantum advantage can be maintained in the presence of noise.

   To address this question, let me introduce our recent work.
 
  It is a joint work with my mate Wei Fuchuan, Professor Cheng Song and my supervisor Professor Liu Zhengwei.
 
  In this work, we propose a method to simulate the noisy observable value of variational quantum algorithms without assumptions(\textipa{ə'sʌmpʃən}) of locality, low entanglement entropy, or circuit depth.
 
  And we rigorously(ri-go-rous-ly;\textipa{'rigərəsli}) prove that the simulation cost is polynomial scale when the simulation error is bounded by a given threshold with high probability.

  This work indicates that, considering the current(ca-rent) experimental capabilities(ca-pu-bilities), most variational quantum algorithms can be classically simulated. 

  
  %We also develop a high-performance program to implement the simulation method and apply(\textipa{ə'plai}) it to simulate IBM's 127-qubit experiment.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{IBM's 127-qubit expriments}
 In 2023, IBM~\footfullcite{kim2023evidence} demonstrated a 2D Ising model simulation task on a 127-qubit quantum computer and claimed it as evidence of the utility of quantum computing.

\note{
  After we find this method, we need to find a good example to test it.

  At that time, we noticed a paper on the cover of Nature.

 \note{\scriptsize

 Let's look at at the footnote first.
 The experimental data from IBM contains two parts.
  The mitigated results which is the noise mitigated results obtained by using the zero noise extrapolation(extra-polation) method, is drawn in blue points.
  
The ZNE is a error mitigation method that estimates noiseless results from the noisy experimental data.

And the second part are the unmitigated results which are the noisy raw experimental data obtained directly from the quantum computer, is drawn in green points.


Let's see the first figure. 
In the first figure, the observable operator is weight one and the circuit is not deep, by light cone method, the involved qubits number is therety-one, thus the ideal exact results can be obtained.

  
 And the ideal exact results are drawn in the black line.

 
  You can see that compared to the unmitigated results, the quantum computer's mitigated results labeled by blue points are consistent(con-sis-tent) with the black line.

  This means that the quantum computer can provide accurate results for this task.

  While for some classical tensor network methods such as 1D matrix product state and 2D isometric tensor network state, they are labeled as red and purple lines, which are far from the black line.

  The situation is similar in the top three figures.

  %In the bottom subfigures, where no ideal results are available, the pattern observed in the top figures suggests that the quantum computer's mitigated results remain reliable, whereas the tensor network methods produce incorrect results.



  For the bottom(\textipa{'bɒtəm}) figures, because there are too many qubits involved, there is no ideal result as a reference.
 
  The quantum computer and classical methods provide different results. But based on the previous(\textipa{ˈpri:viəs}) figures, IBM claimed the results from quantum computer are relatively reliable.
  
  
  %while these results obtained by the tensor network methods can be considered incorrect.


 %This experiment shows that the quantum computer can provide correct results for which the classical approximation fails.

 Among the three figures, our simulation results are more accurate(a-curate:\textipa{ˈækjərət}) than the quantum computer.

And as the footnote shows, the running time for our classical simulation is only at most one hundred and fifty seconds, while the quantum computer would take 5 minutes even don't consider the classical post-processing time.

If considering the post-processing, the quantum computer would take many hours.

So our simulation are faster and more accurate than the quantum computer.

 By the way, the simulation outputs are not just values, but analytical(ana-ly-tical) expressions(\textipa{ik'spreʃ(ə)nz}) respect to the noise rate and rotation angles.

 The rotation angles are the x-axis(\textipa{'æksis}) in these figures.

So we can get the analytical expressions in a single run, and then bring in different rotation angles to get the entire(en-trie累) curve.

 And this makes it possible to add depolarizing(de-polar-rizing) noise to the simulation, and optimize the noise rate to fit the unmitigated results.

 %The raw experimental data is the original noisy expectation value of the quantum circuits without subsequent noise mitigation procedures.

 As the orange line shows, by optimizing the noise rate, our noisy simulation results are consistent with the quantum computer's raw experimental data.

 The optimized noise rate ranges from 0.007 to 0.009, which is consistent with the error rate reported by IBM.

  Our simulation output is analytical expression(\textipa{ik'spreʃ(ə)nz}), which is a function of the noise rate and the rotation angles(\textipa{ˈæŋglz}).

  This brings two advantages.

  First, we can get the entire(\textipa{in'taiər}) curve in a single run.

  While other methods simulate point by point, they need to run the simulation many times to get the entire curve.

  Secondly, because the noise rate is in the expression, we can simulate both the noise mitigated results and the noisy unmitigated results.
  
  By setting the noise rate to zero to mitigate the noise effects(\textipa{i'fekts}), and get the noiseless results. 

  And the noise rate can be optimized to fit the noisy unmitigated results, this makes us possible to simulate the noisy raw experimental data.

  Our method does not depend on assumptions like gate locality or low entanglement entropy. I will explain in more detail later.

\note{
  In addition to the practical utility, we also provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the simulation method.

  We analyze the error of the simulation method and rigorously prove that the cost is polynomial scale when the simulation error is bounded by a given threshold with high probability.

  The computational cost is shown in the box.
  For arbitrary epsilon and delta, the simulation ensures that the error is less than epsilon with probability at least 1 minus delta. With the cost is described in two cases.


  I will explain the two cases later. 

  For the both cases, the cost is polynomial scale to the number of qubits n and the circuit depth L. 

  And there is a exponent factor involves the noise-related value gamma.
  
  %For the first case, the computational cost is influenced by the noise related parameter gamma, and leads to a polynomial relationship with the number of qubits n and the circuit depth L.

  %For the second case, the n and L play a more intertwined(\textipa{ˌintɜ:'twaind}) role.

  %For the both cases, the cost is polynomial scale to n and L. And the exponent(\textipa{ik'spoʊnənt}) factor involves the noise-related gamma.
  
  As noise vanishes, the gamma approaches zero, the cost becomes uncontrolled due to the exponential dependency on the inverse of gamma.

  Thus our result didn't violate(\textipa{'vaiəleit}) the quantum complexity theory(\textipa{'θiəri}).

  This behavior aligns with quantum complexity theory, which suggests that the cost of simulating noiseless quantum circuits grows exponentially.

 This inspires us to truncate the high-weight Pauli paths to approximate the noisy observable value. %Truncating the grey part and only calculating the left part.

 This is formalized as equation 6. The truncated noisy observable value is the sum of the contributions of all Pauli paths with the noise weight less than or equal to M.

 This approach can be viewed as taking the low-order terms of a Fourier-like expansion(ex-ban-sion), and truncating the higher-order contributions.

 In general case, the Fourier transform is taking in the function space, here we take it in the matrix algebra space.

\note{

 For a fixed noise rate gamma which is defined as the minimum of the non-zero noise probabilities, and the arbitrary error epsilon, there exists a classical algorithm to determine(deter-min) the truncated noisy observable value. And the error of the estimation is less than epsilon with the success probability of at least 1 minus delta. over a uniform distribution of the rotation angles.

 And the time complexity is polynomial scale.

  \begin{corollary}
    \label{prop:lambda_and_L}
 For depolarizing noise, assume the quantum circuit $\mathcal{U}(\bm{\theta})$ is splittable and both $O,\rho$ are (pauli-)sparse, with $\norm{O}_\infty$ fixed.
 To estimate $\widetilde{\langle O \rangle}$ with $\mathbb{E}_{\bm{\theta}}\abs{\widetilde{\langle O \rangle}-\langle O \rangle}^2$ less than a sufficiently small constant,
 we have 
      
 1. If \textcolor{red}{$\gamma=\Omega(\frac{1}{\log{L}})$}, a classical algorithm exists that can simulate the circuit in time $\mathrm{Poly}\left(n,L\right)$. 
      
 2. If \textcolor{blue}{$\gamma=\order{\frac{1}{L}}$}, there are instances where OBPPP method exhibits exponential time complexity with respect to $L$.
  \end{corollary}
  \end{mdframed}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\gamma$ is essential to keep below \textcolor{green}{$o(\frac{1}{\log L})$} to ensure the quantum circuit simulation is hard.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
 For the depolarizing noise, we can get the corollary(ke-ro-leri;\textipa{kə'rɒləri}).

 If the experiment is improved, the noise would be reduced. So we can increase the circuit depth to do more computation.


 This result shows a relationship between the noise rate gamma and the circuit depth L.

 If the noise rate gamma is at least inverse logarithmic(log-raise-mic;\textipa{ˌlogə'riðmik}) in the circuit depth L, our classical algorithm can still complete the computation in polynomial time.

 While if the noise rate gamma is at most inverse of the circuit depth L, there are instances that our method would exhibits(\textipa{ig'zibits}) exponential time to L.

 This corollary shows that the noise rate gamma is essential to keep below inverse logarithmic(log-raise-mic) in the circuit depth L to ensure the quantum circuit simulation is hard.

  When the rotation parameters are located in the small angle space $\Theta=\{\bm{\theta}\mid \abs{\theta_i}\leq \theta_* ,i=1,\cdots,L \}$, the truncation error can be upper bounded, as summarized in the following theorem. 
  \begin{mdframed}
    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:truncation_error}
      For any given $\delta>0$, $M>0$ satisfies $\frac{\ln{1+\frac{\delta}{2}}}{L-M}\leq \frac{\ln{2}}{M}$, and Pauli observable $O$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $\theta_*=\frac{\ln{1+\frac{\delta}{2}}}{L-M}=\order{\frac{1}{L-M}}$, then the truncation error satisfies $\abs{\langle O \rangle - \langle O \rangle ^{(M)}}\leq \delta$ for all $\bm{\theta}\in \Theta$.
      \item In average case, if $\theta_*=\sqrt{\frac{3\ln{1+\frac{\delta}{2}}}{L-M}}=\order{\frac{1}{\sqrt{L-M}}}$, then the mean square error $\mathbb{E}_{\bm{\theta}\in \Theta}[(\langle O \rangle - \langle O \rangle ^{(M)})^2]\leq \delta$.

  The efficiency of the algorithm is verified by IBM's 127-qubit experiments, and can be used to fit the raw experimental data.

  The algorithm is also efficient for the improved experimental setting proposed by \cite{anand2023classical}.

  And the efficiency of our algorithm is irrelevant(i-relevant) to the locality of the gates and the entanglement entropy.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Consider other circuit ensembles~(local scrabling) and noise models~(non-unital).
    \item Combing with tensor network~(stablizer tensor network).
    \item Find noise bottleneck in quantum circuits.
    \item Worst-case analysis, noise threshold, monte-carlo method?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
  For the future work, we plan to consider other circuit ensembles and noise models.

  For example, the local scrambling circuit ensemble and the non-unital noise model.

  We also plan to combine our method with tensor network methods, such as the stabilizer tensor network.

  And we can use this method to find the noise bottleneck in the quantum circuits.

  Given a structure of the quantum circuit, we try to find the position where the noise has the most significant impact.

  We also plan to do the worst-case analysis, maybe in worst-case, the noise threshold is important. And maybe monte-carlo method can be used to improve the efficiency of the simulation.
